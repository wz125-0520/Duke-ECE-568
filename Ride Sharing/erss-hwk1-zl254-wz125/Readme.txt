Just notice some things to give you better experince:

1. Every time you make a ride request or sharing request and wanna see back your status, you need to click 'Select your roles ' and choose your corresponding role, then there should be a 'view history' on the top bar, click it and you can edit it.

2. Once you become a driver, you can update your profile in 'Select your roles'---'Driver'---'Update' and also can view your current driver information in 'Profile'

3. When the user request a new ride, the 'Maxinumofpassenger' should be the owner's party number. That is a typo and sorry for the inconvienice.
